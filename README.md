 📊 Overall Churn Rate
50.3 % of customers have churned.➡️ Roughly 1 out of every 2 customers have cancelled their subscription — quite high, indicating major retention issues.

📊 Example from my Dataset:
Total customers = 100%
Customers who churned (churned = 1) = 50.3%
✅ So the churn rate = 50.3%
That means out of every 100 Netflix users, about 50 stopped using or cancelled their subscription.

🧠 Why It Matters?
A high churn rate signals:
Poor customer satisfaction.
Strong competition.
Pricing or value mismatch
Issues with specific features, regions, or plans
A low churn rate means:
Customers are loyal
Retention and satisfaction levels are high
